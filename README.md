# CS330-AI
This repository contains all my course assignments in my Introductory AI course - CS330. 
# List of Assignments
1. **Search:** Pacmant agent will find path through the maze to reach particular locations
2. **Multiagents:**  Designed agents for the pacman game, implemented *minimax*, *expectimax search* and *evaluation function*
3. **Value-Policy Iteration:** Developed code from scratch for implementing *value iteration and policy iteration*
4. **Reinforcement Learning:** Implemented *value iteration* , *policy iteration*, *Q-learning* in the pacman framework
5. **Bayes Nets:** Implemented inference algorithms in bayes nets - *variable elimination* and *VPI computation*
6. **Bayes Nets Sampling:** Developed code from scratch to compute an input query probability on a given Bayes net using *Prior sampling*, *Rejection Sampling*, *Likelihood weighting*, and *Gibbs sampling*.
